                        <p class="text-justify">Progamming is an art as well as a science, it requires one to have a holistic knowledge of core technologies ( ruby & rails ) along with it’s allied technologies ( html, css, js ). For becoming a complete developer one also needs to have a strong foundation on concepts like object oriented programming and database design skills. We at DCT Academy believe that web programming is a skill that anyone can acquire, by walking along a true and trusted path for learning. And yes of course! it requires alot of dedication, hardwork and commitment to the program.</p>
